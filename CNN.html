An essential aspect of life on earth is the presence of plants. In fact, it gives us sustenance, medicines, protect, and provide us with a sound breathable climate. However, with a bloating population, observed climate change and environmental changes, there is a growing risk to several ecosystems. Identification of plant seedling is essential as it can help in recognizing different plant species. In most cases, identification is performed manually, either visually or by microscopy. Recently, manual identification of plant species made it difficult for human experts, and more so for amateurs as it may take several minutes, hours or even days to solve expert tasks. A good understanding of shapes, petal and leaf types, as well as the entire plants, are equally essential to help measure plant condition and even model climate change using machine learning algorithms. Consequently, it is vital to categorize new or unusual plant classes. Furthermore, the interests in image classification are growing. Given the availability of digital images from online databases, the need to create a fast method to classify plant species is urgent.
