    <p><b>overview</b>

    Deep learning applications are used in many industries like Automated driving,
Aerospace and Defense, Medical Research, Industrial Automation, Electronics, etc.
Cancer researchers use deep learning to automatically detect cancer cells. Teams at
UCLA built an advanced microscope that yields a high-dimensional data set used to
train a deep learning application to accurately identify cancer cells. Breast cancer is one
of the main causes of cancer death worldwide. Early diagnostics significantly increases
the chances of correct treatment and survival, but this process is tedious and often
leads to a disagreement between pathologists. Computer-aided diagnosis systems
showed potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. But early detection and prevention
can significantly reduce the chances of death. It is important to detect breast cancer as
early as possible. There are two most important goals for prediction and description.
Prediction involves using some variables in data set to predict unknown values of other
variables and Description concentrates on finding patterns describing the data that can
    be interpreted by human.</p>
